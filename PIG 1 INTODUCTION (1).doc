----PIG-----------

PIG is a Data flow Language

Data flow is a sequence collection of pipes.

pipe is a data operation, the operation can be loading data,filtering,transformations,merging
sorting,grouping,aggregation etc...

At each pipe either transformation/filtering will take place.

pig processing will happen using many built-in-operators

Disadvantages of MR:

1.Huge coding
2.Lot of programming(knowledge)
3.Joins,group by,order by are complex to implement,requires huge code 
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Advantages of Pig:

1.less coding
2.Complex operations can be performed in a simple manner
3.100 lines of MR equivalent  to 7 lines of pig

For PIG, we use a language called PIG-LATIN

PIG-LATIN: PIG-LATIN is a scripting language which is used to define various built-in operators
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PIG Termninologies:

1.Relation-in sql,it is table name
2.Bag ----in sql,it is table
3.Tuple---in sql,it is row
4.Field---in sql,it is column

1.Field: An entity which is just like column in sql
  ex: eid,ename,esal

2.Tuple: collection of field values forms a tuple
         just like row in sql
         ex: (101,john,10000,m,11)
         values stored in tuple as ( )

3.Bag: collection of tuples forms a Bag
       ex: (101,john,10000,m,11)
           (102,miller,20000,m,12)

  There are 2 types of Bags
  1.Outer Bag
  2.Inner Bag

 1.Outer Bag: collection of tuples forms a Bag called outer bag
 2.Inner Bag: In a bag,if a field is taken as bag,then that bag is called as inner bag

4.Relation: Relation is nothing but, a name to a bag(outer bag). 
            Relation is nothing but a bag referred by a name

eX:
        (101,miller,10000,m,11)
        (102,Blake,20000,m,12)
        (103,sony,30000,f,11)
        (104,sita,40000,f,12)
        (105,Ajay,50000,m,13)
    

Here each row or record is called a tuple
here,each column is called a field
collection of tuples(4) is called bag(outer bag)
A name to outer bag is called Relation
in a tuple, if a bag is taken as a field,the that bag is called inner bag
ex:
grp =group emp by dno
(11,{(101,miller,10000,m,11),(103,sony,30000,f,11)})
(12,{(102,Blake,20000,m,12),(104,sita,40000,f,12)})
(13,{(105,Ajay,50000,m,13)})

Here we have 3 tuples
Each tuple consists of 2 fields
1.dno
2.set of tuples taken as one field forms a bag called inner bag



---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Datatypes in Pig:
2 types
1.Simple datatypes: int,float,long,double,boolean,chararray,bytearray
2.Complex data types: tuple,bag

ex:
name-------->char array
age---------->int
sal----------->int/float
married------->boolean
1 emp detail---->tuple
               (101,john,10000,m,11)

employees details--->outer bag
        (101,john,10000,m,11)
        (102,miller,20000,m,12)
        (103,Blake,10000,m,11)
        (104,miller,20000,m,12)

person and his family details---->inner bag
          
             (101,john,10000,m,11,{(child1,age,ht,wt),(child2,age,ht,wt)})

if data is loaded into pig,then by default it is taken as bytearray,later it is converted into
corresponding datatypes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Different modes of PIG Execution:
1.Local mode
2.HDFS mode or clustered mode or mapreduce mode

1)Local mode: opening pig in local mode
  $ pig -x local
  grunt> 
  grunt shell started in local mode

  here pig takes i/p from local(LFS) and writes o/p into local(LFS)
  Advantage: Local mode Used for Development & Testing

2)HDFS mode: opening pig in HDFS mode
  $ pig
  grunt>
  grunt shell started in HDFS mode
  here pig takes i/p from HDFS and writes o/p into HDFS
  Advantage: HDFS mode used for production

  while working with PIG,we open 2 terminals
  PIG----->in local mode,(used for development & testing),Here first we run here,if success,we run in HDFS mode
  PIG----->in HDFS mode,(used for production)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  PIG Latin Statement format

 relation=operator along with expression

ex:  emp= load 'user/file1' as (id:int,name:chararray,sal:int,sex:chararry,dno:int);

 -here emp is a relation
 -here operator is load,
 -and remaining everthing is expression.

 -Expressions will be changing from one operator to another
 -various operators: load,store,group etc...
 -Pig processing happens using various built-in operators or commands
 -The total PIG flow will again be converted into MR job during processing.
